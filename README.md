## Introduction
StolenNetwork is a networking framework based on a custom [CrabNet](https://github.com/Iam1337/CrabNet) implementation (a fork of [RakNet](http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/)). The main goal of StolenNetwork is to make real-time gaming networks as simple as possible.

**This framework is not compatible with the original RakNet.**
